                            <p>Rei Ayanami is known as the First Child, and pilots EVA 00. At the beginning of the series, little is known about Rei, and her stoic personality puzzles her peers. As the series progresses, her personality evolves, and she becomes more involved with the people around her.</p>

He lived a very laid-back life with his sensei, until he was told to pilot EVA 01. He didn't want to do it, but he yearned for praise and love from his father. He often tells himself "I mustn't run away!" and he seems to often double think on his choices.</p>

Asuka started training as a pilot from a very young age, and she is very proud of it. She often, if not always, wears her <span class="highlight">A10 nerve clips</span> on her hair because she wants everyone to know that she is a pilot.</p>

                                <h3>Mari Makinami</h3>
                                    <p>Mari appears in <span class="highlight">Rebuild of Evangelion</span> and does not have a "Child" title. Out of all the pilots, she is the only one who admits that she genuinely enjoys piloting. Her repeated comments suggest that she enjoys the smell of LCL. She's uninhibited, identifying Shinji as a pilot in their first encounter by crawling up to him on all fours and sniffing for the smell of LCL. It is implied that Mari works for an unknown third party.</p>
                                
                                    <p>She's probably the most positive person in the whole series</p>

                                <h3>Kaworu Nagisa</h3>
                                    <p>He is the 5th Child sent to pilot EVA Unit 02 after Asuka ran into some problems. Because most of his information are spoilers, I will not say anything more.</p>
